# This is a title
Create a new file with the number you would like the order of the message to appear in. Such as: '03.md'. Where the order would be (first) 01, 02 and the final message on top would be (last) 03.

Add the content to the file. 

<br /><br />
Using ["Markdown"](https://www.markdownguide.org/) it's possible to create messages. As long as the files in the public repository end with `.md` the messages will be picked up in this page.

It's also possible to include images !["images"](https://picsum.photos/200) such as this one in text.

After creating the file with content, add the file to your git repository (`git add .`, commit the new message `git commit -am "Added a new message"` and push the changes `git push`). The message will be available right away.
